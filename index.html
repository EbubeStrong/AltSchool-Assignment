          My goal in Altschool Africa's School of Software Engineering is to
          learn the skills and knowledge necessary to become a successful
          software engineer. I am particularly interested in using my skills to
          build innovative software products that solve real-world problems. I
          also intend to use my experience at Altschool Africa to inspire others
          to pursue careers in software engineering, as I believe that Africa
          needs more software engineers to build the future of the continent.
